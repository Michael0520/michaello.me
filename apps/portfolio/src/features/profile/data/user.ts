  about: `
Hello, World! I am Michael Lo — a Full Stack Web Developer passionate about creating efficient, high-performance solutions with modern web technologies.

I specialize in building modern web applications using Next.js, TypeScript, and React. I believe in working smarter, not harder — my philosophy is simple: avoid reinventing the wheel and learn technologies that make tomorrow a little lazier.

As someone who values efficiency, I find repetitive tasks frustrating. That's why I'm passionate about learning new technologies that automate workflows and free up time for what matters.

**Coding is my way of making tomorrow a little lazier.**

## Why This Blog?

My memory isn't the best — information seems to fade after just a couple of weeks. To solve this problem, I decided to document and share my learning journey through technology.

Here, I share insights on frontend and backend development, algorithm practice notes, and technical tips. If you have any suggestions, feel free to leave a comment — I'll do my best to respond!

## Beyond Coding

Besides coding, I'm passionate about gaming, especially strategy games like Teamfight Tactics and Hearthstone. I'm also an anime enthusiast — the more over-the-top, the better!

Let's connect and build something great together!
